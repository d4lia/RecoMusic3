      The group has been signed to Vagrant Records, where they released their
      debut album Language & Perspective in 2014. The band's sound is inspired
      from 1970s and 1980s post-punk pioneers like The Cure and Elvis Costello.

      Here. Their third and most recent album, Mystic Truth, was released on
      March 22, 2019.

      Unstable, which were originally intended for release on Mystic Truth but
      were later removed from the album. They were released on April 24th and
      May 15th 2020, respectively.
