    <p class="white artist-info">
      Paul Van Haver (born 12 March 1985), better known by his stage name
      Stromae, is a Belgian musician, rapper, singer and songwriter. He
      established himself in both the hip hop and electronic music genres.
    </p>

    <p class="white artist-info">
      Stromae came to wide public attention in 2009 with his song "Alors on
      danse" (from the album Cheese), which became a number one in several
      European countries. In 2013, his second album Racine carrée was a
      commercial success, selling 2 million copies in France alone and nearly
      600,000 units elsewhere. He has sold over 8.5 million records worldwide.
    </p>

    <p class="white artist-info">
      His music is primarily sung in French, though he has performed some songs
      in Flemish. The name "Stromae" comes from switching the "mae" and "stro"
      in the word "maestro".This inversion is a result of French slang known as
      verlan.
    </p>

    <p class="white artist-info">
      Stromae is known for his distinctive physique and clothing style. He has
      used this image in launching a limited fashion line, Mosaert (an anagram
      of his stage name). The collection features bright colors and geometric
      patterns, and has been described as "hipster" and "retro kitsch". Stromae
      has said that he wanted to "create a bridge between British style and
      African aesthetic".
