    <p class="white artist-info">
      The Academic are an Irish indie rock band, formed in Rochfortbridge,
      County Westmeath in 2013. The band consists of Craig Fitzgerald, Dean
      Gavin, and brothers Matthew and Stephen Murtagh.
    </p>

    <p class="white artist-info">
      Their début studio album, Tales from the Backseat, was released in January
      2018, entering the Irish Albums Chart at number one. The album was
      nominated for Album of the Year at the Choice Music Prize in January 2019.
    </p>

    <p class="white artist-info">
      Such was the reaction to the release of their début EP, Loose Friends, in
      October 2015, that the band sold out their first show at Dublin venue
      Vicar Street.
    </p>

    <p class="white artist-info">
      In January 2016, the band were selected by RTÉ 2FM to represent Ireland at
      Eurosonic Noorderslag in Groningen, which resulted in numerous festival
      bookings and extensive radio airplay across Europe that year.
